##### MomCare: PharmAccess Maternal & Child Health Program

The MomCare program aims to drive better outcomes in maternity care with a value-based care model, combining mobile communication, quality support, and innovative financing features.   

MomCare has been active in Tanzania since 2019, supporting over 40,000 pregnancy journeys at 40 clinics. 

- Invested in clinics **to close any gaps in government funding for MNCH services** (incl. antenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care)
- Tested the impact of **incentives for patients and providers**

**Key finding:** On top of the available government funding, **an investment of 75K TSh per PJ** at public clinics is **sufficient to achieve good-quality pregnancy journeys**
