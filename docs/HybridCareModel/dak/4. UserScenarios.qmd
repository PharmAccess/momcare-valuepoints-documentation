            Ruth arrives at the Mamatoto-accredited clinic for her first antenatal visit. After confirming her identity, she provides her personal details to Ann (the receptionist). Ann informs Ruth about the Hybrid care program, specifically detailing the aspect of data sharing between providers. Upon approving taking part in the program, Ruth signs a consent form. Ann logs into the HMIS system using the secure credentials. Upon entering the system, she searches in the system using identifiers like a national ID or phone number to check if Ruth has an existing record. As the record does not already exist in the system, Ann selects the “Register New Patient” option and then fills in the necessary details, including the mother’s full name, date of birth, contact information, and gestational age (if known).  She then directs Ruth to the attending nurse.
