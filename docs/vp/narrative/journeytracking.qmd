## Journey Tracking

**ValuePoints (VPs)** are a set of standardized metrics designed to assess and incentivize high-quality maternal healthcare delivery. These metrics quantify key aspects of care throughout the pregnancy journey, offering insights into maternal care-seeking behavior and rewarding healthcare providers for timely and essential service delivery.

Developed with guidance from the Leapfrog-to-Value Maternity Playbook (2024), the ValuePoints framework integrates WHO maternity care guidelines with practical insights gained from [**MomCare implementation**](../../momcare/narrative/momcare.qmd). This approach ensures alignment with both global best practices and local healthcare systems to drive improved maternal and neonatal outcomes.

### How ValuePoints Work

Each pregnant participant can attain up to **10 ValuePoints**, allocated across key maternity services. Healthcare providers earn these points by registering service delivery in a digital health management tool, ensuring transparency and accountability. The core **care indicators** include:

- **Early antenatal care (<12 weeks)**
- **Early ultrasound (<24 weeks)**
- **Comprehensive antenatal screening (full ANC profile)**
- **At least four antenatal care (ANC) visits**
- **Facility-based delivery**
- **At least two postnatal care (PNC) visits**

Services with stronger evidence linking them to positive health outcomes are weighted more heavily, reinforcing the importance of high-value care interventions. Additionally, ValuePoints can be **shared among multiple providers**—for instance, when a facility refers a patient for an ultrasound, points are distributed between the referring and receiving providers. This approach fosters collaboration and continuity of care across the maternal health system.

A high **ValuePoint score** reflects a more complete journey, and serves as a valuable proxy for , high-quality maternity care. The score aims to provide a simplified overview of care practices to assess maternal health interventions, allocate resources effectively, and drive quality improvements.

Furthermore, while VPs primarily measure care delivery outcomes, **patient experience surveys**—adapted from the ICHOM Pregnancy and Childbirth standard set—are incorporated to integrate maternal feedback. Future iterations of the framework will leverage these insights to enhance patient-centered care and ensure that maternity services are not only effective but also respectful and responsive to women’s needs.

### Take-aways

By adopting the **ValuePoints approach**, care providers and policy makers have access to a digital tool that **incentivizes best practices**, **strengthens provider accountability**, and ultimately, **improves maternal and neonatal health outcomes** at scale.
