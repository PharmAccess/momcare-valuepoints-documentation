##### ValuePoints

ValuePoints (VPs) consist of a set of six indicators that reflect the quality of pregnancy care. Each indicator is assigned a number of points and a maximum of 10 points can be obtained for each pregnancy journey. A small financial incentive is earned by the healthcare provider for every point that is obtained. A dashboard ensures that the healthcare provider has real-time insights into their performance on the quality indicators and expected reimbursement as well as a benchmark view. For network managers (like a district or county government), the dashboard also contains an overview page of all the clinics. 
The ValuePoints are designed for low-resource settings, which informed the following key design decisions: 
    - The indicators are adapted from WHO and local guidelines for pregnancy care
    - The indicators are easy to understand for healthcare providers
    - Healthcare providers are able to take action to improve these indicators
    - Limited data is required to calculate the VPs
    - A small financial incentive is linked to to the VPs so that the intervention can be adopted in settings with limited budget

**The objective of the ValuePoints is to improve quality of pregnancy care.**
-	The financial incentive allows for healthcare providers to invest in quality improvements. Examples include drug procurement, outreach programs, & 
-	The insights stimulate behaviour change at the healthcare providers which lead to increased adherence by both healthcare providers and pregnant women to the pregnancy care pathway.
-	Points can be shared by healthcare providers if a woman attends multiple clinics. This creates a shared sense of responsibility between healthcare providers and promotes collaboration.
-	Improved data entry leads to better insights and informed decision-making at network level, especially compared to paper-based reporting.  

ValuePoints demonstrate the implementation of an interoperable, value-based approach that connects healthcare providers with data, enabling secondary use of data for improved decision-making, and incentivizing care quality to transform maternal health outcomes.
