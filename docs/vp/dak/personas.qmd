#### Related personas
**(Expecting) mothers** and **nurses** do not directly interact with the digital system and are not directly involved in decision making processes that are part of this intervention. They are related personas through the ANC procedures that are underlying to this intervention. As such, they are taken along in this DAK for a comprehensive explanation.

#### Additional considerations for contextualizing personas

[COMMENT PS: TO DECIDE IS WE NEED THIS SECTION]

Although this section provides an overview of the generic roles of the targeted personas, it will be important to contextualize these personas to your setting. The generic personas described in Tables 3 and 4 can be supplemented by reflecting on these additional considerations:

- Background and demographics: for example, gender, age, whether they are from the community, familiarity with digital devices, do they own a mobile phone or a smartphone.
- Local environment and any relevant contextual information about their surroundings: for example, work-site characteristics; rural or urban; availability of electricity, water, internet; distance from nearest referral facility.
- Expected roles and responsibilities: What are the expected roles and responsibilities based on the country context? How does this differ from the roles and responsibilities defined by WHO?
- Actual roles and responsibilities: What are their actual roles and responsibilities, if there is any difference from what is expected?
- Context: What is the level of internet connectivity? How are they compensated? How far away is the nearest referral facility? What other personas or health workers do they interact with?
- Challenges: What are the day-to-day challenges the end user might face?
- Motivations: What does success look like to them? Are there targets they need to achieve?
