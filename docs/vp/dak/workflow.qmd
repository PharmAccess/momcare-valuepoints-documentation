## WhatsApp Enrollment Steps

1. **User Engagement**:
   - The user initiates the process by typing any message (e.g., "start") in the WhatsApp chatbot.
   - The bot responds with a welcome message that introduces its purpose and offers two buttons: "Register" and "Ask a Question."

2. **Consent Collection**:
   - A consent form is sent to the user through WhatsApp. The user must accept the terms to proceed with the enrollment.

3. **Enrollment Initiation**:
   - Upon providing consent, the bot asks the user to confirm if the number they are using is their WhatsApp number for future communication.
   - The user confirms and taps the "Start Registration" button to begin enrollment.

4. **Information Collection**:
   - The bot sequentially collects the following information:
     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Date of Birth
     - Marital Status
     - Nationality
     - ID Number
     - Telephone Number
     - Hospital for receiving services
     - Last Menstrual Period (LMP)
     - Health conditions
     - Previous pregnancy details

5. **Confirmation**:
   - After verification, a unique Beneficiary ID is generated and shared with the user, marking the completion of the enrollment process.

6. **Follow-Up**:
   - Post-enrollment, the system sends automated reminders for antenatal care visits and collects feedback from mothers about their healthcare experiences.
