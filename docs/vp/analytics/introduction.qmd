# Introduction

Health data in FHIR format is rich but highly nested. Without a solid ETL pipeline and smart data modeling, you end up drowning in complexity.

It then becomes challenging how HL7 FHIR data flowing from a maternal health program can be used to generate the metrics used to compute value points for facilities in a program

In this guide, we’ll walk through the journey from raw FHIR bundles to dashboards, highlighting the architectural choices and open-source building blocks that make it all possible.

## Who Should Read This?

Whether you’re a:

- **Data Engineer** interested in orchestration, data modeling, and analytics pipelines  
- **Product Manager** or **Digital Health Implementer** evaluating integration, scalability, and deployment  
- **Developer** looking to customize or extend the solution  
- **Health Informatics Expert** exploring value-based care models powered by real-time, interoperable data  

you’ll find everything you need to understand how we transform complex HL7 FHIR data into analytics-ready formats.

## What is covered

1. **ETL Automation**  
   How we extract, transform, and load FHIR resources at scale while preserving data integrity. We assume you are using the resources defined in [MNCH FHIR profile](https://github.com/PharmAccess/MamaToTo-FHIR-IG)

2. **Data Flattening & Modeling**  
   The strategies we use to denormalize FHIR data for efficient metric calculation and reporting.

3. **Metric Computation**  
   Generating the [ValuePoints metrics](../dak/metrics.qmd) demonstrated for a maternal health program.

4. **Visualization & Reporting**  
   Turning flattened data into dashboards and reports that drive actionable insights.  

By the end of this section, it'll be clear how the ValuePoints Tool leverages open-source technologies to deliver a scalable, interoperable analytics solution for real-time health data.  

## Key Repositories

Below are the core projects that lead to the calculation of value points:
