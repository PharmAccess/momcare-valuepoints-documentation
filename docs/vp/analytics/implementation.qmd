## Data Pipeline 
We provide a **base reporter** that extracts the most important information for the ValuePoints tool from the FHIR resources into standardized tables. These standardized tables serve as a starting point for further analysis.

### [Patient timeline table](pipeline.qmd)
In the ValuePoints tool, the patientâ€™s journey over time is tracked. This means that most important information would be captured with a table that tracks each procedure, treatment, or diagnosis that a patient receives over time. For this reason we implemented a functionality to create the patient timeline table.

Based on the base reports described above, different reports of interest can be created:

#### [Value Points Reporter](metrics.qmd)

Value point reports provide the value points (described in the value points section) obtained by clinics by threathing their patients.

#### [DHIS2 Reporter](dhis2.qmd)

DHIS2 reports provide insight in how many mothers visit a clinic, what conditions occur amongst mothers that visit that clinic, and what procedures mothers obtain in a clinic.
