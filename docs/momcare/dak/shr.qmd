## Shared Health Record
The **Shared Health Record (SHR)** is a business service component of the **OpenHIE architecture** in the Connected Care Stack. It functions as a **longitudinal clinical repository**, enabling a unified view of a patient’s health history across encounters, systems, and providers.

By adopting a **FHIR-native approach** through the use of the **HAPI FHIR Server**, the SHR facilitates **standards-based clinical data exchange**, promoting patient-centered continuity of care across digital and physical services.

### Master Data Management (MDM)

To enable accurate and reliable patient identification across systems, the SHR system leverages **Master Data Management (MDM)** configurations that ensure consistent and accurate identification of patients across different systems. This includes:

- **Patient Identity Matching**:  
  The system uses algorithms such as **Probabilistic Matching** and **Deterministic Matching** to ensure accurate linking of patient records.

- **Duplicate Record Prevention**:  
  Built-in tools prevent the creation of duplicate records by continuously monitoring and comparing patient data entries.

- **Centralized Patient Index**:  
  A single authoritative record for each patient is maintained, ensuring that data related to a patient is consistent and reliable across the healthcare ecosystem.

- **Cross-System Patient Identification**:  
  The system supports cross-system identity matching, enabling patient identification across different healthcare providers and systems using shared data sources.

#### MDM Rules.
The SHR applies MDM rules that define how patient data is validated, matched, and linked across various health systems. These rules ensure that:

- **Data Integrity**:  
  All incoming patient data is checked for completeness and accuracy before being stored in the SHR.

- **Data Consistency**:  
  Rules are enforced to ensure that patient data remains consistent across different platforms and that any updates to patient records are properly tracked.

- **Identity Matching Logic**:  
  The system uses configurable matching algorithms to determine when records belong to the same patient. This can be tailored based on specific healthcare requirements, ensuring that data discrepancies are minimized.

- **Data Merging**:  
  When duplicate records are detected, MDM rules ensure that the correct action is taken, whether it’s merging data or flagging for review.

- **Security & Compliance**:  
  Patient identification rules are aligned with security regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, ensuring patient confidentiality and data protection.

## FHIR Implementation Guides

The SHR is implemented using multiple **FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs)** to ensure broad compatibility and use-case alignment:

| IG Name | Purpose | Key FHIR Resources |
|--------|---------|--------------------|
| [**SMART on FHIR**](https://smarthealthit.org/) | SMART on FHIR allows third-party applications to integrate seamlessly with health systems. It provides secure authorization and access to electronic health record (EHR) data. | `Patient`, `Observation`, `Encounter`, `Medication` |
| [**FHIR for Mobile Health (mHealth)**](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mhealth.html)| This IG supports mobile applications that interact with health records. It provides guidance on how mobile apps should consume FHIR data for patient care. | `Observation`, `MedicationRequest`, `DiagnosticReport` |
| [**FHIR for EHR**](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/ehr.html)| The EHR IG defines how FHIR resources can be used to manage health records electronically. | `Patient`, `Practitioner`, `Encounter`, `Observation` |
| [**FHIR for Clinical Data Interchange**](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinical.html)| This IG focuses on the exchange of clinical data across different health systems using FHIR. | `Patient`, `Condition`, `Procedure`, `Observation` |
