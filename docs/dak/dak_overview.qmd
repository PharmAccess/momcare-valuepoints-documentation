# Digital Adaptation Kit Overview

## Background.
The Digital Assessment Kit (DAK) is a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative designed to streamline the development and implementation of effective digital health solutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It provides a standardized framework and a set of tools to guide stakeholders through the process of assessing the feasibility, effectiveness, and scalability of digital health interventions.
This document details the project's specifics using the DAK framework.
The DAK framework emphasizes a user-centered approach, ensuring that digital health solutions address the specific needs and challenges faced by healthcare providers and patients in LMIC settings. By following the DAK guidelines, developers and implementers can increase the likelihood of developing digital health solutions that are sustainable, impactful, and contribute to improved health outcomes.

### Core Data Elements in the ValuePoints Tool
The ValuePoints tool leverages a set of data elements captured across the care journey of pregnant women, to enable data-driven quality-improvements.  
The data elements are captured at various points across the journey. The "WHO SMART ANC Guideliens" provide detailed definitions of data capture processes for these data elements. 

Here's a categorized overview of some core data elements that are used for the ValuePoints Tool:

### mamatoto (for reference)

1. Patient Sociodemographics: Name, date of birth, address, phone number.
2. Pregnancy Information: Estimated due date, gestational age, pregnancy history.
3. Antenatal Visit Data: Blood pressure, weight, fetal development observations.
4. Referral & Service Utilization: Referrals to specialists or additional services.
5. Immunization Records: Tracking of vaccinations received during pregnancy.
6. Laboratory Test Results: Integration of relevant lab test results.

#### Sample Business Processes and Data Elements:

The DAK also outlines data elements linked to specific business processes within MamaToto. Here are a few examples for illustration:

1. Create Beneficiary: This process captures basic information like name, date of birth, and contact details (MMT.A.DE1 - MMT.A.DE9).
2. Add Beneficiary to Policy: This process includes details beyond basic demographics, such as beneficiary type, occupation, and insurance membership (MMT.B.DE5 - MMT.B.DE23).
3. Download Bulk Enrollment Status: This process manages uploading beneficiary data in bulk. It tracks the reference ID, processing status, and error details (MMT.D.DE01 - MMT.D.DE06).
4. Validate Policy: This process ensures a policy is valid by checking factors like the number of beneficiaries (MMT.E.DE01) and integration errors (MMT.E.DE02).

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list, and the specific data elements used may  change based on evolving needs.

### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements 
This section summarizes the key functional and non-functional requirements for the MamaToto system, ensuring it meets user needs and operates effectively.

#### Functional Requirements:

1. Interoperability Layer (IOL): Acts as a central hub for HIE services, enabling data exchange and message routing between healthcare providers. It also facilitates complex transactions, error management, and secure communication.
2. Shared Health Record (SHR): Serves as a repository for patient clinical data, offering functionalities for data storage, retrieval, querying, and export. It prioritizes data integrity through versioning and audit logs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:

1. Performance: The system should deliver minimal response times and handle asynchronous processes efficiently.
2. Security: Robust security measures are essential, including user authentication, password encryption, data access controls, and audit trails.
3. Usability: An intuitive user interface is crucial for users with varying technical skills.
4. Reliability: Regular system testing ensures accuracy, reliability, and performance under high data loads.

***These are general highlights, and specific requirements will be further elaborated upon in the project documentation.***
