##### Background
FHIR Web is A web based interface for administering FHIR based digital health solutions
Additionally its the most suitable inteface for the Shared Health Record which is the HAPI FHIR Server. 
Setting up FHIR Web Version 3.1.3 is quite challenging given the limited documentation.


#### Challenges
1. Lack of documentation.
While FHIR Web might have some general documentation, it often lacks specific details on how to configure it to work seamlessly with a FHIR server. This is especially true if you need FHIR Web to interact with a FHIR server that requires custom configurations beyond the defaults.

For instance, you might encounter challenges understanding how to:

   1. onfigure FHIR Web to point to your specific FHIR server instance.
   2. Set up authentication between FHIR Web and the FHIR server.
   3. Customize FHIR Web's behavior based on functionalities offered by your FHIR server.

2. Configuration.
