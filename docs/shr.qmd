##### Background.
In the spirit of adopting a FHIR-native approach, the MamaToto Health Information Exchange (HIE) uses the HAPI FHIR Server as its Shared Health Record (SHR). This system ensures seamless data exchange and compatibility across multiple healthcare systems by leveraging the FHIR standard, enabling efficient patient care coordination, data sharing, and interoperability.

#### MDM Configurations.
To allow for unique Patient Identification, the SHR system leverages **Master Data Management (MDM)** configurations that ensure consistent and accurate identification of patients across different systems. This includes:

- **Patient Identity Matching**:  
  The system uses algorithms such as **Probabilistic Matching** and **Deterministic Matching** to ensure accurate linking of patient records.

- **Duplicate Record Prevention**:  
  Built-in tools prevent the creation of duplicate records by continuously monitoring and comparing patient data entries.

- **Centralized Patient Index**:  
  A single authoritative record for each patient is maintained, ensuring that data related to a patient is consistent and reliable across the healthcare ecosystem.

- **Cross-System Patient Identification**:  
  The system supports cross-system identity matching, enabling patient identification across different healthcare providers and systems using shared data sources.

#### MDM Rules.
MDM rules define how patient data is validated, matched, and linked across various health systems. These rules ensure that:

- **Data Integrity**:  
  All incoming patient data is checked for completeness and accuracy before being stored in the SHR.

- **Data Consistency**:  
  Rules are enforced to ensure that patient data remains consistent across different platforms and that any updates to patient records are properly tracked.

- **Identity Matching Logic**:  
  The system uses configurable matching algorithms to determine when records belong to the same patient. This can be tailored based on specific healthcare requirements, ensuring that data discrepancies are minimized.

- **Data Merging**:  
  When duplicate records are detected, MDM rules ensure that the correct action is taken, whether itâ€™s merging data or flagging for review.

- **Security & Compliance**:  
  Patient identification rules are aligned with security regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, ensuring patient confidentiality and data protection.

##### FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) for SHR

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. The SHR system leverages FHIR to ensure compatibility and interoperability with other health systems. Below are the relevant FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) for SHR.

### SMART on FHIR
- **Purpose**: SMART on FHIR allows third-party applications to integrate seamlessly with health systems. It provides secure authorization and access to electronic health record (EHR) data.
- **FHIR Resources Used**: Patient, Observation, Encounter, Medication, etc.
- **Link to SMART on FHIR Implementation Guide**: [SMART on FHIR IG](https://smarthealthit.org/)

### FHIR for Mobile Health (mHealth)
- **Purpose**: This IG supports mobile applications that interact with health records. It provides guidance on how mobile apps should consume FHIR data for patient care.
- **FHIR Resources Used**: Observation, MedicationRequest, Patient, DiagnosticReport, etc.
- **Link to mHealth Implementation Guide**: [FHIR mHealth IG](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mhealth.html)

### FHIR for Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- **Purpose**: The EHR IG defines how FHIR resources can be used to manage health records electronically.
- **FHIR Resources Used**: Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, Observation, etc.
- **Link to EHR Implementation Guide**: [FHIR EHR IG](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/ehr.html)

### FHIR for Clinical Data Interchange
- **Purpose**: This IG focuses on the exchange of clinical data across different health systems using FHIR.
- **FHIR Resources Used**: Patient, Observation, Procedure, Condition, etc.
- **Link to Clinical Data Interchange IG**: [FHIR Clinical Data IG](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinical.html)
