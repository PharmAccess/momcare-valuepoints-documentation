Mothers are shown that have visited the clinic at least once during their journey. AS a mother can fall in two trimesters within one month, we have decided to show the status at the 1st of the month. Table: Business rules for the stratification of care users across trimesters.\nTRIMESTER START END FIRST week 1 week 12 SECOND week 13 week 26 THIRD week 27 week 42 or date of delivery PAST EDD week 42 or date of delivery week 46\n\n\nObtained Points\nThere is a limited time in which the different value points can be obtained per patient. The cut-off date and the total number of value points that can be obtained for each topic are displayed in the graph below. The week of pregnancy (gestational age) for a mother is calculated based on her Expected Delivery Date (EDD). In the care process, the EDD is estimated by adding 280 days to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). Criterium Points Cut-off-date ANC profile 1 12 weeks Early ANC 1 24 weeks Ultrasound before end of second trimester 1 24 weeks 4ANC 2 42 weeks Facility Based Delivery 4 42 weeks 2PNCs 1 44 weeks The date assigned to an obtained ValuePoint is the date that a procedure was performed.\n\n\nMissed Value Points\nIf a mother does not obtain a value point before the cut-off date, we consider this value point as missed. Missed value points are linked to a missed date. The missed date is calculated based on the EDD and the cut-off weeks. A mother can go to different clinics during her journey. At this point, we only calculate missed value points for the clinic where the mother had her first visit.\n\n\nAttainable Value Points\nAttainable points are only calculated for the current date and defined for any topic that has not yet been obtained, but where the current date is earlier than the missed date. Attainable points are only given to the clinic where the mother had her first visit.\n\n\nShared Value POints\nA pregnant woman can visit different clinics. She can decide to do this for various reasons, including referral for certain medical conditions. To promote continuity of care, the concept of shared value points was introduced. Value points can be shared for: • Ultrasound • 4 ANC • Facility Based Delivery • 2 PNC For Ultrasound and Facility Based DElivery the value points are always shared between the clinic where the procedure took place (procedure clinic) and the clinic where the first visit took place (enrollment clinic). The value points are shared as follows: CRITERIUM PROCEDURE CLINIC ENROLLMENT CLINIC ULTRASOUND 0.75 0.25 FACILITY BASED DELIVERY 3 1 4ANC* 0.5 per visit\n2PNC* 0.5 per visit\nThe date for these shared value points is defined as the date that the procedure was performed. For the 4ANC and 2PNC criteria, points are only assigned if the mother had at least 4 ANC visits or at least 2 PNC visits in total. For further visits, no value points are obtained.",

    "text": "ValuePoints\nValuePoints (VPs) consist of a set of six indicators that reflect the quality of pregnancy care. Each indicator is assigned a number of points and a maximum of 10 points can be obtained for each pregnancy journey. A small financial incentive is earned by the healthcare provider for every point that is obtained. A dashboard ensures that the healthcare provider has real-time insights into their performance on the quality indicators and expected reimbursement as well as a benchmark view. For network managers (like a district or county government), the dashboard also contains an overview page of all the clinics. The ValuePoints are designed for low-resource settings, which informed the following key design decisions: - The indicators are adapted from WHO and local guidelines for pregnancy care - The indicators are easy to understand for healthcare providers - Healthcare providers are able to take action to improve these indicators - Limited data is required to calculate the VPs - A small financial incentive is linked to to the VPs so that the intervention can be adopted in settings with limited budget\nThe objective of the ValuePoints is to improve quality of pregnancy care. - The financial incentive allows for healthcare providers to invest in quality improvements. Examples include drug procurement, outreach programs, & - The insights stimulate behaviour change at the healthcare providers which lead to increased adherence by both healthcare providers and pregnant women to the pregnancy care pathway. - Points can be shared by healthcare providers if a woman attends multiple clinics. This creates a shared sense of responsibility between healthcare providers and promotes collaboration. - Improved data entry leads to better insights and informed decision-making at network level, especially compared to paper-based reporting.\nValuePoints demonstrate the implementation of an interoperable, value-based approach that connects healthcare providers with data, enabling secondary use of data for improved decision-making, and incentivizing care quality to transform maternal health outcomes.",

These indicators are defined as: Early ANC: An antenatal care (ANC) visit registered within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (ANC &lt; 12 weeks) ANC profile: Full antenatal care profile administered.\nTo count the mothers who had a full ANC profile, we check for visits that include the following procedures: • VDRL test • hemoglobin • blood grouping • HIV test • blood pressure • urine test In addition, the ANC profile should take place during the first visit.\nUltrasound before end of second trimester: We check for visits with an ultrasound procedure that occurred within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. (Ultrasound &lt; 24 weeks) 4+ ANCs: Four or more registered antenatal care visits. Clinics receive 0.5 points per visit for the first 4 visits. For further ANC visits no more points are received. Facility Based Birth: We filter mothers that have given birth at a healthcare facility. 2+ PNCs: Two or more registed postnatal care (PNC) visits. Clinics receive 0.5 points per visit for the first 2 visits. For further PNC visits no more points can be obtained.\n\n\nProvider Dashboards\nThe service indicators could be monitored in the ValuePoints dashboard, available to the individual care provider and the district managers. The VP system automatically generates these VP dashboards from patient data, allowing providers to visualize the completeness of maternal care and act promptly to deliver better value. The dashboard displayed ValuePoints as obtained points compared to the total missed and attainable points for the specific providers. Additionally, the providers’ VPs were compared to the average percentage of points earned at other providers. This way insights about care delivery were generated for health management both at the provider and district level. Dashboard screenshots The dashboards present a summarized view of the ValuePoints across their patient population. This dashboard includes a few elements: 1. Patients per trimester: This element shows how the pregnancy journeys of active maternal care users are distributed for this specific clinic. 2. Total ValuePoints: This indicates the percentage of the obtained ValuePoints out of the attainable ValuePoints. It provides the sum of ValuePoints and the total budget this translates into in the provider wallet. 3. Monthly Performance 4. Service Specific Perfomance 5. Journey performance over Time 6. Indicators over Time The dashboard allowed stratification by risk groups to enable closer monitoring and promote risk prevention measures. High risk patients were defined based on existing health complications, or high age. Teenagers were defined as (under 18 years old). • Definition of risk groups\n\n\nFinancial model\nEach indicator was assigned a Value Point that can be attained by the provider and linked to a monetary reward of 7,500 TSh. Value Points can also obtained in a shared manner; for example when one facility referred to another for ultrasound, the VP for this service would be shared across the two. Adequate reporting of services in the ValuePoint system by the provider thereby generated extra budget to procure additional resources for care delivery. The sum of the rewards linked to the obtained ValuePoints, was calculated in the provider’s wallet. In the Hanang implementation, the available budget in the wallet was used to place orders for necessary supplies, such as equipment, medication. The local PharmAccess team managed the procurement and delivery of supplies based on providers choices. As such the VP system assumed that these incentives would drive improved agency and (collaborative) resource management, ultimately impacting the quality and value of care delivery.",
