    "text": "Implementation in Hanang\n\n\nPregnancy Journey Quality Indicators\nValue Points are assigned to key service indicators across the pregnancy journey. These indicators are defined as: Early ANC: An antenatal care (ANC) visit registered within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (ANC &lt; 12 weeks) ANC profile: Full antenatal care profile administered.\nTo count the mothers who had a full ANC profile, we check for visits that include the following procedures: • VDRL test • hemoglobin • blood grouping • HIV test • blood pressure • urine test In addition, the ANC profile should take place during the first visit.\nUltrasound before end of second trimester: We check for visits with an ultrasound procedure that occurred within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. (Ultrasound &lt; 24 weeks) 4+ ANCs: Four or more registered antenatal care visits. Clinics receive 0.5 points per visit for the first 4 visits. For further ANC visits no more points are received. Facility Based Birth: We filter mothers that have given birth at a healthcare facility. 2+ PNCs: Two or more registed postnatal care (PNC) visits. Clinics receive 0.5 points per visit for the first 2 visits. For further PNC visits no more points can be obtained.\n\n\nProvider Dashboards\nThe service indicators could be monitored in the ValuePoints dashboard, available to the individual care provider and the district managers. The VP system automatically generates these VP dashboards from patient data, allowing providers to visualize the completeness of maternal care and act promptly to deliver better value. The dashboard displayed ValuePoints as obtained points compared to the total missed and attainable points for the specific providers. Additionally, the providers’ VPs were compared to the average percentage of points earned at other providers. This way insights about care delivery were generated for health management both at the provider and district level. Dashboard screenshots The dashboards present a summarized view of the ValuePoints across their patient population. This dashboard includes a few elements: 1. Patients per trimester: This element shows how the pregnancy journeys of active maternal care users are distributed for this specific clinic. 2. Total ValuePoints: This indicates the percentage of the obtained ValuePoints out of the attainable ValuePoints. It provides the sum of ValuePoints and the total budget this translates into in the provider wallet. 3. Monthly Performance 4. Service Specific Perfomance 5. Journey performance over Time 6. Indicators over Time The dashboard allowed stratification by risk groups to enable closer monitoring and promote risk prevention measures. High risk patients were defined based on existing health complications, or high age. Teenagers were defined as (under 18 years old). • Definition of risk groups\n\n\nFinancial model\nEach indicator was assigned a Value Point that can be attained by the provider and linked to a monetary reward of 7,500 TSh. Value Points can also obtained in a shared manner; for example when one facility referred to another for ultrasound, the VP for this service would be shared across the two. Adequate reporting of services in the ValuePoint system by the provider thereby generated extra budget to procure additional resources for care delivery. The sum of the rewards linked to the obtained ValuePoints, was calculated in the provider’s wallet. In the Hanang implementation, the available budget in the wallet was used to place orders for necessary supplies, such as equipment, medication. The local PharmAccess team managed the procurement and delivery of supplies based on providers choices. As such the VP system assumed that these incentives would drive improved agency and (collaborative) resource management, ultimately impacting the quality and value of care delivery.",

The logic used for determining when a service has been obtained or missed is described below. Similarly, the dashboard will show these indicators for historic months, where the same logic holds. The purpose of these indicators is to quickly identify in which areas a clinic has a high or low “Obtained” score, and to be able to compare that to previous months.\n[TABLE - LET’S DISCUSS CONTENT FIRST]\n\n\n\nFor the current month only, the dashboard will also visualise the number of “eligible mothers”.\n\nEligible mothers: On this given day, all mothers that are within the right time frame to obtain a service.\n\nThe goal of the “Eligible mothers” indicator is to induce action to be taken by the provider.

    "text": "Insert something here about sql on fhir flow\n\n\n\nThis documentation aims to provide the reader with context and information about the methods used to transform the patient timeline data to the tables used in the dashboard. For this transformation Data Build Tool (DBT) is used.\n[Github Code] (https://github.com/PharmAccess/open-mnch-dbt-analytics)\n\n\nThe input for the DBT workflow is a folder named “base_reports”. This folder contains two subfolders called “patient timeline” and “patient info”. These folders contain parquet files with patient timeline and patient information extracted from FHIR resources.\nPatient timeline → contains information about patient encounters.\nPatient info → contains patient information extracted from FHIR resources.\nThese Parquet files are used as sources in this DBT project. Additional descriptions for sources can be found in the DBT docs.\n\n\n\nThe next step is to apply the necessary filters to the patient timeline, enrich the patient timeline and patient info data and lastly combine the two datasets. This results in the “patient_timeline_combined” dataset. The code for the models (tables) can be found at models/value_points/staging. In the following sections, we will discuss all models displayed in the image below.\n\n\nThe timeline data can include multiple pregnancy journeys per patient. For now, the timeline is filtered to include only the most recent pregnancy journey for every patient.

    "text": "This documentation aims to provide the reader with context and information about the methods used to transform the patient timeline data to the tables used in the dashboard. For this transformation Data Build Tool (DBT) is used.\n[Github Code] (https://github.com/PharmAccess/open-mnch-dbt-analytics)\n\n\nThe input for the DBT workflow is a folder named “base_reports”. This folder contains two subfolders called “patient timeline” and “patient info”. These folders contain parquet files with patient timeline and patient information extracted from FHIR resources.\nPatient timeline → contains information about patient encounters.\nPatient info → contains patient information extracted from FHIR resources.\nThese Parquet files are used as sources in this DBT project. Additional descriptions for sources can be found in the DBT docs.\n\n\n\nThe next step is to apply the necessary filters to the patient timeline, enrich the patient timeline and patient info data and lastly combine the two datasets. This results in the “patient_timeline_combined” dataset. The code for the models (tables) can be found at models/value_points/staging. In the following sections, we will discuss all models displayed in the image below.\n\n\nThe timeline data can include multiple pregnancy journeys per patient. For now, the timeline is filtered to include only the most recent pregnancy journey for every patient.

    "text": "Background.\nIn the spirit of adopting a FHIR-native approach, the MamaToto Health Information Exchange (HIE) uses the HAPI FHIR Server as its Shared Health Record (SHR). This system ensures seamless data exchange and compatibility across multiple healthcare systems by leveraging the FHIR standard, enabling efficient patient care coordination, data sharing, and interoperability.\n\n\nMDM Configurations.\nTo allow for unique Patient Identification, the SHR system leverages Master Data Management (MDM) configurations that ensure consistent and accurate identification of patients across different systems. This includes:\n\nPatient Identity Matching:\nThe system uses algorithms such as Probabilistic Matching and Deterministic Matching to ensure accurate linking of patient records.\nDuplicate Record Prevention:\nBuilt-in tools prevent the creation of duplicate records by continuously monitoring and comparing patient data entries.\nCentralized Patient Index:\nA single authoritative record for each patient is maintained, ensuring that data related to a patient is consistent and reliable across the healthcare ecosystem.\nCross-System Patient Identification:\nThe system supports cross-system identity matching, enabling patient identification across different healthcare providers and systems using shared data sources.\n\n\n\nMDM Rules.\nMDM rules define how patient data is validated, matched, and linked across various health systems. These rules ensure that:\n\nData Integrity:\nAll incoming patient data is checked for completeness and accuracy before being stored in the SHR.\nData Consistency:\nRules are enforced to ensure that patient data remains consistent across different platforms and that any updates to patient records are properly tracked.\nIdentity Matching Logic:\nThe system uses configurable matching algorithms to determine when records belong to the same patient. This can be tailored based on specific healthcare requirements, ensuring that data discrepancies are minimized.\nData Merging:\nWhen duplicate records are detected, MDM rules ensure that the correct action is taken, whether it’s merging data or flagging for review.\nSecurity & Compliance:\nPatient identification rules are aligned with security regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, ensuring patient confidentiality and data protection.\n\n\nFHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) for SHR\nFHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. The SHR system leverages FHIR to ensure compatibility and interoperability with other health systems. Below are the relevant FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) for SHR.\n\n\n\nSMART on FHIR\n\nPurpose: SMART on FHIR allows third-party applications to integrate seamlessly with health systems. It provides secure authorization and access to electronic health record (EHR) data.\nFHIR Resources Used: Patient, Observation, Encounter, Medication, etc.\nLink to SMART on FHIR Implementation Guide: SMART on FHIR IG\n\n\n\nFHIR for Mobile Health (mHealth)\n\nPurpose: This IG supports mobile applications that interact with health records. It provides guidance on how mobile apps should consume FHIR data for patient care.\nFHIR Resources Used: Observation, MedicationRequest, Patient, DiagnosticReport, etc.\nLink to mHealth Implementation Guide: FHIR mHealth IG\n\n\n\nFHIR for Electronic Health Records (EHR)\n\nPurpose: The EHR IG defines how FHIR resources can be used to manage health records electronically.\nFHIR Resources Used: Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, Observation, etc.\nLink to EHR Implementation Guide: FHIR EHR IG\n\n\n\nFHIR for Clinical Data Interchange\n\nPurpose: This IG focuses on the exchange of clinical data across different health systems using FHIR.\nFHIR Resources Used: Patient, Observation, Procedure, Condition, etc.\nLink to Clinical Data Interchange IG: FHIR Clinical Data IG\n\n\n\nAdditional FHIR Resources\nFor a deeper dive into the FHIR standard and related Implementation Guides, refer to the official FHIR documentation: - FHIR Official Site: HL7 FHIR"

    "text": "User scenarios\nUser scenarios are a narrative description of how the end user would interact with the digital system. The user scenario is provided to help the reader better understand how the system will be used and how it would fit into existing workflows. The following illustrative examples provide scenario’s that may be common when utilizing the dashboard:\n\nUser scenario for registration of a mother and an ANC visit (Exemplary summarized process. No interaction with the digital system).\nUser scenario for analysis of historical data in the dashboard.\nUser scenario for identifying actionable groups of mothers in the dashboard.\nUser scenario for utilization of the dashboard by a district official.\nUser scenario for incentives payment based on value points.\n\nNote with regards to user scenario 1: As has been stated earlier, this DAK does not intend to focus on the process of registration of patients and execution of ANC touchpoints, as the main digital system described in this DAK (the dashboard) is not used during these processes. Those processes have been described in detail in other sources (LINK 1 EN LINK 2). Availability of the core data elements (LINK TO THAT SECTION) is a prerequisite to the use of the dashboard. As such, the user scenario below is to provide an example of those data elements are collected in a real-life setting.\n\nUser scenario for registration of a mother and an ANC visit.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nClient: Leyla MNCH nurse: Anne\n\n\n\n\nThis is Leyla’s first time coming to this health-care facility. The clerk asks about the services she is seeking and directs her to the reproductive and child health (RCH) unit where she is received by an MNCH nurse, Anne.  Anne asks questions regarding Leyla’s reason for coming to the facility, as well as the date of her last menstrual period (LMP). Anne administers a test to confirm Leyla’s pregnancy. Upon confirming the positive pregnancy test, Anne proceeds to register Leyla on the ANC register and provides her with an RCH card.  Anne then asks more detailed questions regarding Leyla’s general health status, previous conditions, and obstetric history. Based on the information Leyla provides regarding her LMP, Anne estimates her gestational age. Anne also records Leyla’s weight and height measurements, conducts a physical exam, and prescribes any test as appropriate.  Anne registers all the gathered information in the digital system, as well as on the RCH card where she indicates the date for the next follow-up visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser scenario for analysis of historical data in the dashboard.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nHospital administrator: Josephine Quality improvement officer: Millicent\n\n\n\n\nBy looking at the graphs of the dashboard, Josephine has seen that historically the hospital’s clients come in late for their first ANC visit (after 13 weeks) and only 50% of the mothers attend 4 ANC visits or more prior to delivery. Together with Millicent, she has developed and implemented a new strategy to improve on these two key MNCH quality metrics.  By offering a discount for the first ANC visit for mothers that are less than 13 weeks pregnant, she aims to increase the number of mothers that have a timely first ANC check-up. Also, she has implemented a discount for the 4th ANC visit to mothers that have fulfilled 3 ANC visits at her clinic.  Every other week, Josephine and Millicent have a look at the dashboard together to see whether the score on both metrics improves over time. Also, they monitor whether there is an effect on any of the other metrics, and how their score compares to the average across the district.  Following a period of a consistently improved score for the two metrics, they encounter a sudden change in performance. By checking the historical scores in the graph, they can identify whether this change might be due to a seasonal influence or if there is another matter that needs to be investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser scenario for identifying actionable groups of mothers in the dashboard.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nHead of MNCH department: Ruth Hospital administrator: Josephine\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of each week, Ruth looks at the dashboard to check how many mothers are eligible for specific services. This week, she notices that at this moment, the number of mothers enrolled at her clinic which are expected to deliver within the next 2-4 weeks is 25% higher than usual.  Firstly, she now instructs her team to identify these mothers in the HMIS system and to actively reach out to them to educate the mothers on the process and the benefits of delivery at the facility.  Secondly, she informs Josephine. Together they can adequately plan for sufficient staffing and resources to accommodate for the expected increase in deliveries for the coming period. Josephine can also inform other clinics to which she can refer mothers in case there is a lack of capacity during a sudden overload of needs for service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser scenario for utilization of the dashboard by a district official.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nDistrict Reproductive and Child Health Coordinator: Mary Hospital administrator: Josephine\n\n\n\n\nMary, a District Reproductive and Child Health Coordinator, is responsible for ensuring that health facilities in her district meet key maternal and child health indicators. To monitor the performance of the health facilities, she logs into a program dashboard that showcases the progress of each facility across different indicators such as early ANC visit, timely ultrasound, facility-based delivery, etc.  Mary observes that a specific Health Centre has a significantly low number of women completing the early ANC visit (less than 12 weeks). She contacts the health facility in charge, Ali, to flag the facility’s low performance on the early ANC visit indicator.  Josephine informs her that the low volume of clients visiting the health facility is due to the remoteness of the surrounding villages. After some discussion, they agree to conduct some outreach services, including setting up a mobile clinic at least once a month in each nearby village.  In the next weekly update meeting with the council health management team, Mary shares this proposal and requests for a budget to be allocated from the district health services basket fund to support the clinic’s outreach activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser scenario for incentives payment based on value points.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nPayer (e.g. District Reproductive and Child Health Coordinator): Mary\n\n\n\n\nMary, a District Reproductive and Child Health Coordinator, is responsible for the financial reward payouts to participating facilities. At the end of each quarter, Mary uses the high-level clinic dashboard to identify how many value points each of the clinics in her district has obtained.  Mary writes a short report on the performance of each of the clinics, including a specification of the size of the financial reward per clinic. Mary shares this report with the financial team of the district, who makes the payout to the clinics.",

    "text": "ValuePoints\nValuePoints (VPs) consist of a set of six indicators that reflect the quality of pregnancy care. Each indicator is assigned a number of points and a maximum of 10 points can be obtained for each pregnancy journey. A small financial incentive is earned by the healthcare provider for every point that is obtained. A dashboard ensures that the healthcare provider has real-time insights into their performance on the quality indicators and expected reimbursement as well as a benchmark view. For network managers (like a district or county government), the dashboard also contains an overview page of all the clinics. The ValuePoints are designed for low-resource settings, which informed the following key design decisions: - The indicators are adapted from WHO and local guidelines for pregnancy care - The indicators are easy to understand for healthcare providers - Healthcare providers are able to take action to improve these indicators - Limited data is required to calculate the VPs - A small financial incentive is linked to to the VPs so that the intervention can be adopted in settings with limited budget\nThe objective of the ValuePoints is to improve quality of pregnancy care. - The financial incentive allows for healthcare providers to invest in quality improvements. Examples include drug procurement, outreach programs, & - The insights stimulate behaviour change at the healthcare providers which lead to increased adherence by both healthcare providers and pregnant women to the pregnancy care pathway. - Points can be shared by healthcare providers if a woman attends multiple clinics. This creates a shared sense of responsibility between healthcare providers and promotes collaboration. - Improved data entry leads to better insights and informed decision-making at network level, especially compared to paper-based reporting.\nValuePoints demonstrate the implementation of an interoperable, value-based approach that connects healthcare providers with data, enabling secondary use of data for improved decision-making, and incentivizing care quality to transform maternal health outcomes.",
