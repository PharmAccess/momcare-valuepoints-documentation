This will enable quicker initial solution testing, demonstrations. It will also serve as a starting point for faster production implementation and customisation.\nThe Instant OpenHIE is a simple way for semi-technical persons to install and see a complex system working against a real-world use case. It will illustrate how interoperability can work to solve health challenges. It will also show how a national interoperability architecture could be created with open-source software and standards.\nInstant OpenHIE aim to provide a simple, portable way to deploy health information exchange systems to facilitate:\n\nDemonstrable reference products - those that align with the OpenHIE Community’s vision for low resource contexts\nRapid software development of mediators and point-of-service systems by making it possible to launch several applications easily so the developer can focus on their task\nReproducible, version-controlled infrastructure for user-contributed tests of the OpenHIE Architecture profiles, workflows, and use cases.\nProduction-ready containers and orchestratable components that are deployable in any context.\nExtensibility so that anyone may create Instant OpenHIE packages and plug them into the existing Instant OpenHIE functionality.\n\n\n\nUse Cases\n\nBeneficiary Enrollment - This implementation supports Momcare beneficiary enrollment via Whatsapp using a standards-based approach using FHIR & OpenHIE.\nHybrid maternal care - This implementation supports seamless data sharing of Antenatal Care information between physical and virtual providers."

It authenticates users and authorizes access to the HIE system.\nreverse-proxy-nginx : This component acts as a reverse proxy, routing incoming traffic to the appropriate backend services within the HIE system based on URL patterns.\nmamatoto-datastore-hapi-fhir : This component stores and manages health data in a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It uses the HAPI FHIR server implementation for data persistence and retrieval.\nmamatoto-interoperability-layer-openhim : This component acts as an interoperability layer using OpenHIM. It facilitates data exchange between MamaToto HIE and other disparate health information systems.\nmamatoto-openhim-mediators : These are custom OpenHIM mediators developed specifically for MamaToto HIE. They translate and transform data between different formats to ensure smooth information exchange.\n\nSample config.yml shown below:\nprojectName: MamaToto\nimage: jembi/platform:latest\nlogPath: /tmp/logs\n\npackages:\n  - reverse-proxy-nginx\n  - identity-access-manager-keycloak\n\ncustomPackages:\n  - id: mamatoto-datastore-hapi-fhir\n    path: ./mamatoto-datastore-hapi-fhir\n  \n  - id: mamatoto-interoperability-layer-openhim\n    path: ./mamatoto-interoperability-layer-openhim\n\n  - id: mamatoto-openhim-mediators\n    path: ./mamatoto-openhim-mediators\n\nprofiles:\n  - name: mamatoto\n    packages:\n      - mamatoto-interoperability-layer-openhim\n      - reverse-proxy-nginx\n      - mamatoto-datastore-hapi-fhir\n      - mamatoto-openhim-mediators\n      - identity-access-manager-keycloak\n    envFiles:\n      - .env\n    dev: true\n    only: true\n\nThe config.yml file is a configuration file used by Instant HIE v2 to define your deployment settings. It specifies various options like the project name, Docker image to use, and which Instant HIE packages to include.\nHere’s how it’s used:\n\nCreate the config.yml file: Use a text editor to create a file named config.yml in your project directory.\nEdit the configuration options: Paste the content you want into the file, replacing placeholders with your specific values. Refer to the Instant HIE v2 documentation for a detailed explanation of each configuration option.\nUse the config.yml file: When using the Instant HIE v2 CLI commands (e.g., instant package up), these commands will reference the config.yml file to determine your deployment configuration.\n\nThe provided config.yml example demonstrates how to configure an Instant HIE v2 deployment profile for MamaToto HIE. It includes references to the aforementioned components.\nBy leveraging Instant HIE v2, MamaToto HIE benefits from a simplified deployment process, easier management of its components, and potential scalability for handling increased data exchange needs.",

    "text": "Background.\nIn the spirit of adopting a FHIR-native approach, the MamaToto Health Information Exchange (HIE) uses the HAPI FHIR Server as its Shared Health Record (SHR). This system ensures seamless data exchange and compatibility across multiple healthcare systems by leveraging the FHIR standard, enabling efficient patient care coordination, data sharing, and interoperability.\n\n\nMDM Configurations.\nTo allow for unique Patient Identification, the SHR system leverages Master Data Management (MDM) configurations that ensure consistent and accurate identification of patients across different systems. This includes:\n\nPatient Identity Matching:\nThe system uses algorithms such as Probabilistic Matching and Deterministic Matching to ensure accurate linking of patient records.\nDuplicate Record Prevention:\nBuilt-in tools prevent the creation of duplicate records by continuously monitoring and comparing patient data entries.\nCentralized Patient Index:\nA single authoritative record for each patient is maintained, ensuring that data related to a patient is consistent and reliable across the healthcare ecosystem.\nCross-System Patient Identification:\nThe system supports cross-system identity matching, enabling patient identification across different healthcare providers and systems using shared data sources.\n\n\n\nMDM Rules.\nMDM rules define how patient data is validated, matched, and linked across various health systems. These rules ensure that:\n\nData Integrity:\nAll incoming patient data is checked for completeness and accuracy before being stored in the SHR.\nData Consistency:\nRules are enforced to ensure that patient data remains consistent across different platforms and that any updates to patient records are properly tracked.\nIdentity Matching Logic:\nThe system uses configurable matching algorithms to determine when records belong to the same patient. This can be tailored based on specific healthcare requirements, ensuring that data discrepancies are minimized.\nData Merging:\nWhen duplicate records are detected, MDM rules ensure that the correct action is taken, whether it’s merging data or flagging for review.\nSecurity & Compliance:\nPatient identification rules are aligned with security regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, ensuring patient confidentiality and data protection.\n\n\nFHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) for SHR\nFHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. The SHR system leverages FHIR to ensure compatibility and interoperability with other health systems. Below are the relevant FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) for SHR.\n\n\n\nSMART on FHIR\n\nPurpose: SMART on FHIR allows third-party applications to integrate seamlessly with health systems. It provides secure authorization and access to electronic health record (EHR) data.\nFHIR Resources Used: Patient, Observation, Encounter, Medication, etc.\nLink to SMART on FHIR Implementation Guide: SMART on FHIR IG\n\n\n\nFHIR for Mobile Health (mHealth)\n\nPurpose: This IG supports mobile applications that interact with health records.
