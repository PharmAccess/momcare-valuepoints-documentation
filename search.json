    "text": "Digitally Connected Care\nWhy we need to be able to digitally exchange health data\nThe goal of MomCare is to support continuous, patient-centered care throughout the pregnancy journey, from enrollment through to postnatal care. As services are delivered across multiple points of care‚Äîincluding virtual (SMS, WhatsApp) and physical (clinic visits)‚Äî**the ability to share and reuse health data becomes essential.\nWithout a reliable way to exchange data:\n\nProviders lack full visibility into a mother‚Äôs care history\nOpportunities for timely interventions are missed\nFinancing and quality incentives cannot be linked to actual care delivery\n\nEffective health information exchange (HIE) allows care to be:\n\nCoordinated across providers and time\nPersonalized based on risk and history\nImproved through data-driven analytics\n\nThis enables a shift from fragmented service delivery to a connected care model that improves outcomes and optimizes resource use.\n\n\nScalable Digital Architecture\nWhy we need scalable digital architecture\nIn the early stages of MomCare, our implementations in Kenya and Tanzania relied on custom-built apps and proprietary data pipelines. These systems were effective at capturing and analyzing maternal health data within their limited contexts, but they lacked the flexibility and interoperability needed to scale across regions or integrate with national health infrastructures. Each new implementation required manual integration, one-off development, and repeated setup of custom data flows.\nTo move beyond these limitations, MomCare required a digital architecture that could support reuse, modularity, and consistent integration of diverse tools‚Äîsuch as SMS-based engagement systems, point-of-care applications, analytics dashboards, and claims engines. An open-source and standards-based approach provides this flexibility by allowing individual components to evolve independently while remaining interoperable through shared interfaces and protocols.\nJust as importantly, an open and community-driven architecture encourages transparency, collaboration, and sustainability. It enables MomCare to be adapted by local partners, aligned with national digital health strategies, and maintained without relying on proprietary vendors. This shift from siloed platforms to a shared infrastructure is essential for achieving the kind of scalability and impact we envision for connected maternal care.",

Workflows are a visual representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a ‚Äústory‚Äù for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers.  \n\n\nWorkflows\nWorkflows represent the progression of activities performed within the business process. They help users and stakeholders understand the relationship between activities, data elements and decision-support needs. The workflows shown depict processes that have been generalized and may not reflect variation and nuances across different settings. Also, the simplicity of the workflow may not adequately illustrate non-linear steps that may occur.\n\nA. Workflow for WhatsApp enrolment of a pregnant mother\n\nAnnotations for the business process for WhatsApp enrolment of a pregnant mother 1. Woman enters the clinics. - For the workflow shown in Image XX, the pregnant woman is physically present at the clinic and not yet enrolled in the program. An alternative scenario is that the mother has received the MamaToto WhatsApp phone number or the QR code from family or friends and has started the enrolment at home. In this case, step 1 and 2 are no longer relevant, and the pregnant woman goes directly to step 3.\n\nRegistration personnel instructs mother to WhatsApp enrolment\nInitiating the MamaToto WhatsApp?\n\n\nThere are two ways of initiating the WhatsApp chat. (i) By scanning the QR code, that takes you directly to the chat. (ii) By saving the phone number linked to the WhatsApp chat and opening the conversation in WhatsApp.\n\n\nReview of Terms and Conditions\n\n\nThrough the chat, the pregnant woman is provided with a PDF that contains the terms and conditions for taking part in the MamaToto program.\n\n\nFilling out the enrolment form\nReceiving feedback\n\n\nFollowing completion of the form, the payers systems (handeling the claims and discounted payment) will check the mother for eligibility (to avoid double registrations). Once completed, the pregnant woman receives (i) confirmation of her enrolment as beneficiary of the discounted care program, (ii) het beneficiary ID for the program and (iii) a summary of the information she has provided through the forms.\n\n\n\n\nB.

User scenario for registration to the program by a mother through WhatsApp\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nPregnant woman: Ruth Receptionist: Ann\n\n\n\n\nRuth is a 28-year-old pregnant woman, currently at 10 weeks gestation, who resides in Kajiado County. She is visiting a MamaToto-accredited facility, for her first ANC visit. Ann, a receptionist at the facility, explains the MamaToto program to Ruth and ensures Ruth understands how enrolment for the program is done through WhatsApp chat. Ann shows Ruth a QR code which, upon scanning, opens into the WhatsApp chat on the phone of Ruth.\n Alternatively, Ruth could have heard about the MamaToto program from one of her family members or a pregnant friend who recently ernolled at the clinic. After receiving the WhatsApp enrolment phone number from one of them, Ruth can send a message to the dedicated phone number to start the enrolment from home. After enrolment from home, she will be able to receive the discounted care at a affiliated clinic of her liking.\n Upon sending any message in the chat, a response to register Ruth for the discounted care program will be sent. As a first step, a consent form will be presented to which Ruth can agree or disagree. On agreeing, the follow up questions appear where details such as her name, date of birth, phone number, last menstrual period, basic medical history and ANC profile will be obtained. Following completion of the questionnaire, Ruth receives a confirmation of successful registration, a summary of information she has provided and her unique beneficiary number for the discounted care program.  Ruth will now receive maternal health education and gestational based appointment reminders on her WhatsApp. Following each visit, a follow-up experience survey is sent to Ruth to review the quality of services offered. She will also be able to update her Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) in case needed.  Ann registers all the gathered information in the digital system, as well as on the RCH card where she indicates the date for the next follow-up visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

    "text": "ValuePoints: ‚ÄúA Quality Improvement Tool for Maternal Health‚Äù\nValuePoints (VPs) provide a structured approach to assessing and improving the quality of pregnancy care. By defining a set of six key indicators, the system offers a measurable way to track care delivery throughout the pregnancy journey. Each indicator is assigned a specific number of points, with a maximum of ten points attainable per pregnancy.\nA key feature of ValuePoints is the integration of real-time performance insights through a dashboard. This allows healthcare providers to monitor their adherence to quality standards, track expected reimbursements, and compare their performance to network benchmarks. At the system level, network managers, such as district or county health officials, can oversee clinic performance through aggregated dashboard insights.\n\n\nDesign Considerations\nValuePoints were developed with a focus on applicability in low-resource settings, ensuring that the framework remains practical, scalable, and effective. Key design principles include:\n\nIndicators are adapted from WHO and local pregnancy care guidelines.\n\nMetrics are simple and easy for healthcare providers to understand.\n\nHealthcare providers can take direct action to improve performance on each indicator.\n\nData requirements are minimal, reducing the burden of reporting.\n\nA small financial incentive is linked to ValuePoints to support adoption in resource-limited settings.\n\n\n\nImpact on Quality Improvement\nThe primary goal of ValuePoints is to enhance the quality of pregnancy care by providing healthcare providers with actionable insights and structured incentives. The system supports quality improvement in several ways:\n\nFacilitating investments in care quality ‚Äì Providers can use earned incentives to procure essential supplies, enhance outreach programs, and improve service delivery.\n\nEncouraging behavior change ‚Äì Real-time feedback mechanisms promote adherence to care guidelines among both providers and pregnant women.\n\nStrengthening collaboration ‚Äì Since points can be shared between providers when a woman attends multiple facilities, the system fosters shared responsibility and coordinated care.\n\nEnhancing data quality and utilization ‚Äì Improved data entry leads to more reliable health insights",

    "text": "7. Indicators and performance metrics\nThis chapter details indicators and performance metrics that would be aggregated from core data elements for decision-making, performance metrics, and subnational and national reporting based on data collected from individual-level, routine health systems.\n\nMothers per trimester\nThe mothers per trimester table shows the number of mothers that have visited the clinic and have an active journey (within EDD + four weeks) per month. Mothers are shown that have visited the clinic at least once during their journey. AS a mother can fall in two trimesters within one month, we have decided to show the status at the 1st of the month. Table: Business rules for the stratification of care users across trimesters.\n\n\n\nTrimester\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nWeek 1\nWeek 12\n\n\nSecond\nWeek 13\nWeek 26\n\n\nThird\nWeek 27\nWeek 42 or date of delivery\n\n\nPast EDD\nWeek 42 or date of delivery\nWeek 46\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtained, missed and Attainable points\nThe list in the table below is a set of indicators that can be used to calculate the value points obtained and missed by a provider, which can be visualised in a dashboard. For these same indicators, the attainable points show the potential points that can still be obtained by a clinic in that month.\n\nDefinitions for procedures:\n\nFull ANC profile: Execution of all the following tests/measurements is required to meet the ‚ÄúFull ANC profile‚Äù during the first ANC.\n\nVitals check (BP+Pulse+SPo2+RR)\nVDRL\nHaemoglobine\nBlood grouping\nHIV screening\nBlood pressure\nUrinalysis\n\nANC: All other ANC visits require execution of at least the following tests / measurements to meet the requirements of an ANC:\n\nVitals check (BP+Pulse+SPo2+RR)\nUrinalysis + PrCr\nHaemoglobin (HB)\n\nPNC: All PNC visits require execution of at least the following tests / measurements to meet the requirements of an PNC\n\nVitals check (BP+Pulse+SPo2+RR)\n\n\n\nObtained value points\nThere is a limited time in which the different value points can be obtained per patient. The cut-off date and the total number of value points that can be obtained for each topic are displayed in the graph below. The week of pregnancy (gestational age) for a mother is calculated based on her Expected Delivery Date (EDD). In the care process, the EDD is estimated by adding 280 days to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP).\n\n\n\nCriterium\nPoints\nCut-off date\n\n\n\n\nANC profile\n1\n12 weeks\n\n\nEarly ANC\n1\n24 weeks\n\n\nUltrasound before end of second trimester\n1\n24 weeks\n\n\n4ANC\n2\n42 weeks\n\n\nFacility Based Delivery\n4\n42 weeks\n\n\n2PNCs\n1\n44 weeks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissed value points\nIf a mother does not obtain a value point before the cut-off date, we consider this value point as missed. Missed value points are linked to a missed date. The missed date is calculated based on the EDD and the cut-off weeks. A mother can go to different clinics during her journey. At this point, we only calculate missed value points for the clinic where the mother had her first visit. \n\n\nAttainable Value Points\nAttainable points are only calculated for the current date and defined for any topic that has not yet been obtained, but where the current date is earlier than the missed date. Attainable points are only given to the clinic where the mother had her first visit. \n\n\nShared Value Points\nA pregnant woman can visit different clinics. She can decide to do this for various reasons, including referral for certain medical conditions. To promote continuity of care, the concept of shared value points was introduced.\nValue points can be shared for:\n\nUltrasound\n4 ANC\nFacility Based Delivery\n2 PNC\n\nFor Ultrasound and Facility Based DElivery the value points are always shared between the clinic where the procedure took place (procedure clinic) and the clinic where the first visit took place (enrollment clinic). The value points are shared as follows:\n\n\n\nCriterium\nProcedure Clinic\nEnrollment Clinic\n\n\n\n\nUltrasound\n0.75\n0.25\n\n\nFacility Based Delivery\n3.00\n1.00\n\n\n4ANC*\n0.5 per visit\n\n\n\n2PNC*\n0.5 per visit\n\n\n\n\nThe date for these shared value points is defined as the date that the procedure was performed. For the 4ANC and 2PNC criteria, points are only assigned if the mother had at least 4 ANC visits or at least 2 PNC visits in total. For further visits, no value points are obtained.\n \n[COMMENT PS: BELOW IS THE DOCUMENTATION WE USED FOR THE SAFECARE DASHBOARD. A BIT MORE ELABORATE, BUT LESS FOCUSSED ON THE VALUE POINTS, MORE ON THE DASHBOARD. THAT ALSO WORKED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. WHICH DO WE WANT TO INCLUDE?]\n\n\nMissed and obtained Value Points\nFor each of the 6 indicators, the VP tool will show the number of mothers that have either obtained or missed that service in the current month. The logic used for determining when a service has been obtained or missed is described below. Similarly, the dashboard will show these indicators for historic months, where the same logic holds. The purpose of these indicators is to quickly identify in which areas a clinic has a high or low ‚ÄúObtained‚Äù score, and to be able to compare that to previous months.\n\n\n\nEligible Value Points\nFor the current month only, the dashboard will also visualise the number of ‚Äúeligible mothers‚Äù.\n\nEligible mothers: On this given day, all mothers that are within the right time frame to obtain a service.\n\nThe goal of the ‚ÄúEligible mothers‚Äù indicator is to induce action to be taken by the provider. As such, in this logic ‚ÄúEligible mothers‚Äù for the previous months is always 0 because no actions can be taken anymore.",

Together, these interventions improve health outcomes, enabled by mobile technology and data exchange. To date, MomCare has supported over 60,000 women in Kenya and Tanzania in more than 70 clinics, resulting in good-quality pregnancy journeys at predictable cost.\n\n\nConnected Care Stack\nThe MomCare Connected Care Stack is a modular, interoperable digital infrastructure designed to support quality maternal healthcare delivery across low-resource settings. It connects the full journey of care‚Äîspanning enrollment, direct patient engagement, clinical touchpoints, data exchange, and performance analytics‚Äîinto a seamless digital ecosystem. Built around open standards and real-world integration needs, the stack enables healthcare providers, payers, and policymakers to coordinate care, make data-informed decisions, and deliver person-centered services. By embedding components such as direct patient engagement, health data exchange between service providers, and journey-based analytics for quality improvement, the stack ensures continuity of care and accountability across the maternal health journey. This foundation allows elements of MomCare to be scale efficiently while remaining adaptable to local health system contexts and evolving digital health innovations.\n\n\nHow to read this publication?\nThis open-source publication presents the MomCare model as a modular set of digital components that collectively enable connected pregnancy care journeys. These components are designed to interoperate and build upon one another, forming a flexible digital health architecture that supports personalized, data-informed maternal care.\nAt its foundation, the guide outlines the architecture required for health data exchange, and introduces several key plug-in components that support analytics, patient engagement, and real-time journey monitoring. Each of these components is designed to integrate into the broader system, supporting both care continuity and innovation.\nThis publication is intended as a living, evolving resource. As the design and implementation of the stack matures, this guide will be continuously updated to reflect new insights and adaptations from the field. Among the components, the most advanced to date is the ValuePoints Tool. Lessons from its pilot in Hanang have been integrated, and the tool is now actively being adopted across diverse settings.\nOther components, while still in pilot or early stages (as of May 2025), are shared here to promote open collaboration, early adoption, and localized innovation. By making them available early, we aim to foster a community of contributors who can iterate and co-develop solutions that are practical, scalable, and fit-to-context.\n\nContents of the Connected Care Stack\n\n\n\nMomCare Element\nSoftware Component\nMomCare Implementation\n\n\n\n\nDigitally Connected Care Journey\nHealth Data Exchange Architecture  (Interoperability Layer & Business Service)\nüîó Connected Care\n\n\nDirect Patient Engagement Channel\nPoint of Service System\nüí¨ WhatsApp Engagement\n\n\nJourney-Based Analytics Dashboard\nAnalytics Service\nüìä ValuePoints Tool\n\n\nContinuous Care Services\nIntegrated Point of Service Systems\nü©∫ Hybrid Care Model\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus of (Ongoing) PharmAccess Implementations\nüîó Connected Care The connected care architecture is used and applied across all below implementations.\nüìä ValuePoints Tool The ValuePoints tool has been implementated to support quality improvements in MomCare facilities across Hanang District, Tanzania (2023).

    "text": "User scenarios\nUser scenarios are a narrative description of how the end user would interact with the digital system. The user scenario is provided to help the reader better understand how the system will be used and how it would fit into existing workflows. The following illustrative examples provide scenario‚Äôs that may be common when utilizing the the WhatsApp enrolment feature:\n\nFirst physical consultation at a clinic.\nFirst virtual consultation with telehealth provider.\nRecurring physical consultations at a clinic.\nRecurring virtual consultations with telehealth provider.\n\n\n1. First physical consultation at a clinic.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nPregnant woman: Ruth Registration personnel: Ann MNCH nurse: Eli\n\n\n\n\nRuth arrives at the MamaToto-accredited clinic for her first antenatal visit. After confirming her identity, she provides her personal details to Ann (the receptionist). Ann informs Ruth about the Hybrid care program, specifically detailing the aspect of data sharing between providers. Upon approving taking part in the program, Ruth signs a consent form. Ann logs into the HMIS system using the secure credentials. Upon entering the system, she searches in the system using identifiers like a national ID or phone number to check if Ruth has an existing record. As the record does not already exist in the system, Ann selects the ‚ÄúRegister New Patient‚Äù option and then fills in the necessary details, including the mother‚Äôs full name, date of birth and contact information. She then directs Ruth to the attending nurse.  Eli (ANC Nurse), creates a new medical record for Ruth in the HMIS systems. Eli begins documenting the antenatal visit. He enters key findings, including the mother‚Äôs current gestational age, vital signs such as blood pressure and weight, any relevant medical history, and the results of lab tests. Additionally, Eli records the advice and counseling provided, such as guidance on nutrition, supplements, and recognizing potential danger signs during pregnancy. Any risks or complications noted during the visit are carefully documented as well.  Once the data is entered and reviewed for accuracy, Eli saves the record. Automatically, the systems pushes the new patient record to the Shared Health Record (SHR). The system validates the information and successfully synchronizes it, making Ruth‚Äôs visit details accessible to other healthcare providers involved in her care, to ensure continuity of care and a seamless care journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. First virtual consultation with telehealth provider.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nPregnant woman: Ruth Virtual care coordinator: John Virtual healthcare provider: Cecilia\n\n\n\n\nAs the care coordinator at the telehealth company, John is responsible for ensuring patient registration and administration is done appropriately. John open the HMIS system and is alerted that new patients have been enrolled for the hybrid care program at the physical provider. With a single click on a button, he can see the biodata of Ruth, including her name and phone number, yet does not have access to her medical data. John creates a new patient record in the HMIS system for Ruth, which is largely pre-filled by the system with the biodata collected during the first ANC visit at the physical provider. John ensure that the first virtual consultation is booked in the agenda of the virtual healthcare provider.  Cecilia (Virtual healthcare provider) has received an alert that a new mother (Ruth) has been registered in the MamaToto hybrid care program and is due for her first virtual consultation. As Cecilia is about to initiate a virtual touchpoint with Ruth, she opens the viewer that present the medical history stored in the SHR, ensuring she has up-to-date knowledge of Ruths medical status which includes the antenatal findings from her previous visit to the physical clinic. She then calls Ruth to do the virtual check-up.  Cecilia proceeds to update Ruth‚Äôs record with the latest findings from the virtual consultation. This includes any new symptoms or concerns Ruth reports and any advice, medication prescriptions or recommendations provided during the consultation. Once all the new information has been documented, Cecilia saves the updated record in the system. Ruths information is then pushed to the SHR to update her record, ensuring that Ruth‚Äôs antenatal care data is available and up-to-date for any future care providers who may need access.  Ruth completes her virtual visit feeling assured that her health records are in good hands, and that the continuity of care across both physical and virtual settings is maintained through seamless integration with the SHR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Recurring physical consultations at a clinic.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nPregnant woman: Ruth MNCH nurse: Eli\n\n\n\n\nRuth returns to the healthcare clinic for her recurring physical ANC check-up. Eli, the MNCH nurse, open the HMIS system and find Ruth‚Äôs medical record by searching with her phone number or national ID number. Then, Eli opens the viewer that shows the medical records of Ruth that is stored in the SHR. Eli is now able to see the key medical information and notes recorded during (i) all the previous visits at his own clinic and (ii) all virtual touchpoints with the virtual healthcare provider. As such, Eli now has a comprehensive overview of Ruth‚Äôs pregnancy care journey and is able to provide high quality care.  During the ANC visit, he records all relevant information (as is described earlier) and ensures this is correctly stored in the SHR for any future visits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Recurring virtual consultations with telehealth provider.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nPregnant woman: Ruth Virtual healthcare provider: Cecilia\n\n\n\n\nFor each scheduled virtual touchpoint, Cecilia opens the viewer that present the key medical information and notes recorded during (i) all the previous visits at the physical healthcare facility and (ii) all virtual touchpoints. As such, Cecilia now has a comprehensive overview of Ruth‚Äôs pregnancy care journey before she initiates the call. She then calls Ruth to do the virtual check-up.  During the virtual touchpoint, Cecilia records all relevant information (as is described earlier) and ensures this is correctly stored in the SHR for any future touchpoints.",

The generic personas described in Tables 3 and 4 can be supplemented by reflecting on these additional considerations:\n\nBackground and demographics: for example, gender, age, whether they are from the community, familiarity with digital devices, do they own a mobile phone or a smartphone.\nLocal environment and any relevant contextual information about their surroundings: for example, work-site characteristics; rural or urban; availability of electricity, water, internet; distance from nearest referral facility.\nExpected roles and responsibilities: What are the expected roles and responsibilities based on the country context? How does this differ from the roles and responsibilities defined by WHO?\nActual roles and responsibilities: What are their actual roles and responsibilities, if there is any difference from what is expected?\nContext: What is the level of internet connectivity? How are they compensated? How far away is the nearest referral facility? What other personas or health workers do they interact with?\nChallenges: What are the day-to-day challenges the end user might face?\nMotivations: What does success look like to them? Are there targets they need to achieve?",

This means that most important information is captured in a table that tracks each procedure, treatment, or diagnosis that a patient receives over time. This is the patient timeline table (Fig. 2). The patient timeline table is created based on the following FHIR resources: Patient, Procedure, Condition, Encounter, Observation, Organization.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The Patient Timeline Table\n\n\nEach row in the table represents an unique event that occurred for the patient, for example the diagnosis of a condition or provision of a procedure. As such, multiple events can occur during a single visit of a mother to a clinic. Events are organised in chronological order. The data elements within the green box are part of the core data elements, meaning they are expected to be obtained during the registration process or during a visit. The data elements within the purple box are calculated based on the core data elements.\n\n\nThe patient information table\nThe patient information table mostly shows data elements part of the core data elements list.

    "text": "4. User scenarios\nUser scenarios are a narrative description of how the end user would interact with the digital system. The user scenario is provided to help the reader better understand how the system will be used and how it would fit into existing workflows. The following illustrative examples provide scenario‚Äôs that may be common when utilizing the dashboard:\n\nUser scenario for registration of a mother and an ANC visit (Exemplary summarized process. No interaction with the digital system).\nUser scenario for analysis of historical data in the dashboard.\nUser scenario for identifying actionable groups of mothers in the dashboard.\nUser scenario for utilization of the dashboard by a district official.\nUser scenario for incentives payment based on value points.\nUser scenario for providers tracking how financial rewards are obtained and spent\nUser scenario for extraction of DHIS2 reports.\n\n Note with regards to user scenario 1: As has been stated earlier, this DAK does not intend to focus on the process of registration of patients and execution of ANC touchpoints, as the main digital system described in this DAK (the dashboard) is not used during these processes. Those processes have been described in detail in other sources, as mentioned here. Availability of the core data elements is a prerequisite to the use of the dashboard. As such, the user scenario below is to provide an example of those data elements are collected in a real-life setting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. User scenario for registration of a mother and an ANC visit.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nPregnant woman: Ruth MNCH nurse: Eli\n\n\n\n\nThis is Leyla‚Äôs first time coming to this health-care facility. The clerk asks about the services she is seeking and directs her to the reproductive and child health (RCH) unit where she is received by an MNCH nurse, Anne.  Anne asks questions regarding Leyla‚Äôs reason for coming to the facility, as well as the date of her last menstrual period (LMP). Anne administers a test to confirm Leyla‚Äôs pregnancy. Upon confirming the positive pregnancy test, Anne proceeds to register Leyla on the ANC register and provides her with an RCH card.  Anne then asks more detailed questions regarding Leyla‚Äôs general health status, previous conditions, and obstetric history. Based on the information Leyla provides regarding her LMP, Anne estimates her gestational age. Anne also records Leyla‚Äôs weight and height measurements, conducts a physical exam, and prescribes any test as appropriate.  Anne registers all the gathered information in the digital system, as well as on the RCH card where she indicates the date for the next follow-up visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. User scenario for analysis of historical data in the dashboard.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nHospital administrator: Josephine Quality improvement officer: Millicent\n\n\n\n\nBy looking at the graphs of the dashboard, Josephine has seen that historically the hospital‚Äôs clients come in late for their first ANC visit (after 13 weeks) and only 50% of the mothers attend 4 ANC visits or more prior to delivery. Together with Millicent, she has developed and implemented a new strategy to improve on these two key MNCH quality metrics.  By offering a discount for the first ANC visit for mothers that are less than 13 weeks pregnant, she aims to increase the number of mothers that have a timely first ANC check-up. Also, she has implemented a discount for the 4th ANC visit to mothers that have fulfilled 3 ANC visits at her clinic.  Every other week, Josephine and Millicent have a look at the dashboard together to see whether the score on both metrics improves over time. Also, they monitor whether there is an effect on any of the other metrics, and how their score compares to the average across the district.  Following a period of a consistently improved score for the two metrics, they encounter a sudden change in performance. By checking the historical scores in the graph, they can identify whether this change might be due to a seasonal influence or if there is another matter that needs to be investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. User scenario for identifying actionable groups of mothers in the dashboard.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nHead of MNCH department: Leyla Hospital administrator: Josephine\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of each week, Leyla looks at the dashboard to check how many mothers are eligible for specific services. This week, she notices that at this moment, the number of mothers enrolled at her clinic which are expected to deliver within the next 2-4 weeks is 25% higher than usual.  Firstly, she now instructs her team to identify these mothers in the HMIS system and to actively reach out to them to educate the mothers on the process and the benefits of delivery at the facility.  Secondly, she informs Josephine. Together they can adequately plan for sufficient staffing and resources to accommodate for the expected increase in deliveries for the coming period. Josephine can also inform other clinics to which she can refer mothers in case there is a lack of capacity during a sudden overload of needs for service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. User scenario for utilization of the dashboard by a district official.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nDistrict Reproductive and Child Health Coordinator: Mary Hospital administrator: Josephine\n\n\n\n\nMary, a District Reproductive and Child Health Coordinator, is responsible for ensuring that health facilities in her district meet key maternal and child health indicators. To monitor the performance of the health facilities, she logs into a program dashboard that showcases the progress of each facility across different indicators such as early ANC visit, timely ultrasound, facility-based delivery, etc.  Mary observes that a specific Health Centre has a significantly low number of women completing the early ANC visit (less than 12 weeks). She contacts the health facility in charge, Ali, to flag the facility‚Äôs low performance on the early ANC visit indicator.  Josephine informs her that the low volume of clients visiting the health facility is due to the remoteness of the surrounding villages. After some discussion, they agree to conduct some outreach services, including setting up a mobile clinic at least once a month in each nearby village.  In the next weekly update meeting with the council health management team, Mary shares this proposal and requests for a budget to be allocated from the district health services basket fund to support the clinic‚Äôs outreach activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. User scenario for incentives payment based on value points.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nPayer (e.g.¬†District Reproductive and Child Health Coordinator): Mary\n\n\n\n\nMary, a District Reproductive and Child Health Coordinator, is responsible for the financial reward payouts to participating facilities. At the end of each quarter, Mary uses the high-level clinic dashboard to identify how many value points each of the clinics in her district has obtained.  Mary writes a short report on the performance of each of the clinics, including a specification of the size of the financial reward per clinic. Mary shares this report with the financial team of the district, who makes the payout to the clinics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. User scenario for providers tracking how financial rewards are obtained and spent.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\n RCH in-charge: Raymond\n\n\n\n\nRaymond is responsible for the stock-ups of essential commodities and equipment at the RCH ward. Every few weeks, Raymond looks at the clinic dashboard to check the budget generated by the obtained ValuePoints.\n Raymond also looks at the availability of commodities and equipment to provide the services needed to obtain the ValuePoints. With this information, he writes an order to use the budget for essential stock-ups like Calcium supplements, Urine strips, a Doppler Machine and a Neonatal weigh scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. User scanario for extraction of DHIS2 reports.\n\n\n\nKey Personas\n\n\nFacility In-Charge: Said\n\n\n\n\nSaid is responsible for submitting the monthly DHIS2 reports. At the end of every month, he opens the data entry application and selects the ‚ÄúDHIS2 report‚Äù view.\n This report shows the count of patients per key service needed for the DHIS2 report. For example showing the count of ANC visits they had this year at this facility. He copies this information and enters it into the required fields in the DHIS2 reporter tool.",

Generic business processes and workflows\n\nBusiness processes\nA business process is a set of related activities or tasks performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area. Workflows are a visual representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a ‚Äústory‚Äù for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers. This DAK focuses on key business processes conducted by the personas as part of the Value points intervention.\nNote: This DAK does not intend to focus on the process of registration of patients and execution of ANC touchpoints, as the main digital system described in this DAK (the dashboard) is not used during these processes. The corresponding business process and workflows have been described in the ‚ÄúDigital Adaptation Kit for Antenatal Care: Operational requirements for implementing WHO recommendations in digital systems‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows\nWorkflows represent the progression of activities performed within the business process. They help users and stakeholders understand the relationship between activities, data elements and decision-support needs. The workflows shown depict processes that have been generalized and may not reflect variation and nuances across different settings. Also, the simplicity of the workflow may not adequately illustrate non-linear steps that may occur .\n\nA. Business process for analysis of historic and current performance metrics in the dashboard.\nObjective: To monitor the effect of implemented quality improvement interventions\n\nAnnotations for the business process for analysis of historic and current performance metrics in the dashboard\nGeneral note: For this workflow, it is expected that previously in time the hospital leadership has identified a performance area of weakness and implemented a quality improvement intervention to improve that area of performance. There is no fixed frequency for viewing the performance metrics in the dashboard.\n\nReview performance metrics on dashboard.\n\n\nThe hospital administrator checks the dashboard every other week to monitor the activity in the hospital.\n\n\nIdentify abnormalities or unexpected results.\n\n\nSpecial attention is given to the performance metric which they aim to improve through the quality improvement intervention. The hospital administrator checks whether the expected improvement is achieved / continued.\n\n\nPotential issues?\n\n\nIn case no improvement is seen, or if the improvement is stagnating, for a significant period of time, the administrator will need to discuss this with the quality improvement officer.\nIf there are no potential issues identified, there is no follow up action for the administrator.\n\n\nReview of potential issues\n\n\nThe quality improvement officer can further identify the impact of this issue and reasons for why the expected effect is not achieved.\n\n\nAction required?\n\n\nIf the quality improvement officer sees the need, and room, for adjustment of the intervention, a plan for adjustment is made. This plan is communicated to the head of the MNCH department to implement these changes in the daily operation.\nIn case the quality improvement officers deems no action need (for example as more time is needed to see the effects of the intervention), there is no immediate follow up action.\n\n\nImplement measures / execute actions\n\n\nThe head of MNCH department ensures the MNCH team is made aware of the adjustments to the intervention and oversees timely execution by the team.\n\n\n\nB. Identifying actionable groups of mothers in the dashboard.\nObjective: Identifying actionable groups of mothers in the dashboard.\n\nAnnotations for the business process for identifying actionable groups of mothers in the dashboard\nGeneral note: For this workflow, it is expected that the Head of MNCH department has a clear understanding of volumes of services provided through prior interactions with the dashboard. There is no fixed frequency for identifying actionable groups of mothers, the data updates on a daily basis.\n\nReview numbers of expected services for coming week.\n\n\nAt the start of every week, the head of MNCH department checks the dashboard to determine the number of mothers that are eligible for specific services.\n\nThe MNCH nurse can identify which mothers are eligible and very shortly due for the services and reach out to them to ensure they are aware of the next step in their care journeys.\n\n\n\nIdentify significant outliers.\n\n\nThe MNCH department head assesses if the expected volume of services to be provided exceeds the tolerance for the usual volumes, which can be both an decrease or increase of service. If so, he/she needs to assess whether the current resources, both human and equipment, are adequate to cover for the change is volume of service.\n\n\nNeed for adjustment of resources?\n\n\nIn case there is adequate human resource and equipment, no adjustment is needed and there is no further action.\nIn case adjustment of resources is needed, this is communicated to the Hospital Administrator.\n\n\nIdentify ability to adjust human capacity and procurement\n\n\nThe Hospital administrator must determine if the hospital is in the position to make the required adjustments. This includes financial resources, availability of human resources and availability of space.\n\n\nAdjustment possible?\n\n\nIn case the hospital is not in the position to make the adjustments to accommodate for the change in volumes of services, there is no action needed.\n\nIn case of an expected increase in volume of service, the hospital administrator might need to assess alternative ideas to prevent overloading of the hospital that might negatively impact the quality of care. This could for example be diverting patients to other hospitals.\n\nIf they can adjust resources, the instruction is given to the head of MNCH to coordinate the changes.\n\n\nCoordinate adjustment with team.\n\n\nThe head of MNCH department will provide instructions to the MNCH team.\n\n\nImplement adjustment.\n\n\nThe MCNH nurse will implement the changes.",

By reusing the same event-level data source:\n\nConsistency is ensured across all analytics outputs\n\nDuplication of ETL logic is eliminated\n\nRisk of transcription or aggregation errors is significantly reduced\n\nThese reports deliver insights on clinic attendance (e.g., number of mothers per visit), prevalent maternal conditions, and performed procedures, all derived from the unified patient timeline.\n\n\n\nOnce the Patient Timeline is in place, additional ValuePoints reports (e.g., program adherence, outcome measures) can be implemented by building on the base tables and models.",

    "text": "Specification for the Implementation in Hanang\n\n\nPregnancy Journey Quality Indicators\nValue Points are assigned to key service indicators across the pregnancy journey.\nThese indicators are defined as:\nEarly ANC: An antenatal care (ANC) visit registered within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (ANC &lt; 12 weeks)\nANC profile: Full antenatal care profile administered.\nTo count the mothers who had a full ANC profile, we check for visits that include the following procedures:\n‚Ä¢   VDRL test \n‚Ä¢   hemoglobin\n‚Ä¢   blood grouping\n‚Ä¢   HIV test\n‚Ä¢   blood pressure\n‚Ä¢   urine test\nIn addition, the ANC profile should take place during the first visit.\nUltrasound before end of second trimester: We check for visits with an ultrasound procedure that occurred within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. (Ultrasound &lt; 24 weeks)\n4+ ANCs: Four or more registered antenatal care visits. Clinics receive 0.5 points per visit for the first 4 visits. For further ANC visits no more points are received.\nFacility Based Birth: We filter mothers that have given birth at a healthcare facility.\n2+ PNCs: Two or more registed postnatal care (PNC) visits. Clinics receive 0.5 points per visit for the first 2 visits. For further PNC visits no more points can be obtained.\n\n\nProvider Dashboards\nThe service indicators could be monitored in the ValuePoints dashboard, available to the individual care provider and the district managers. The VP system automatically generates these VP dashboards from patient data, allowing providers to visualize the completeness of maternal care and act promptly to deliver better value. The dashboard displayed ValuePoints as obtained points compared to the total missed and attainable points for the specific providers. Additionally, the providers‚Äô VPs were compared to the average percentage of points earned at other providers. This way insights about care delivery were generated for health management both at the provider and district level. Dashboard screenshots The dashboards present a summarized view of the ValuePoints across their patient population. This dashboard includes a few elements:\n\nPatients per trimester: This element shows how the pregnancy journeys of active maternal care users are distributed for this specific clinic.\nTotal ValuePoints: This indicates the percentage of the obtained ValuePoints out of the attainable ValuePoints. It provides the sum of ValuePoints and the total budget this translates into in the provider wallet.\nMonthly Performance\nService Specific Perfomance\nJourney performance over Time\nIndicators over Time\n\nThe dashboard allowed stratification by risk groups to enable closer monitoring and promote risk prevention measures. High risk patients were defined based on existing health complications, or high age. Teenagers were defined as under 18 years old.\n\n\nFinancial model\nEach indicator was assigned a Value Point that can be attained by the provider and linked to a monetary reward of 7,500 TSh. Value Points can also obtained in a shared manner; for example when one facility referred to another for ultrasound, the VP for this service would be shared across the two. Adequate reporting of services in the ValuePoint system by the provider thereby generated extra budget to procure additional resources for care delivery.\nThe sum of the rewards linked to the obtained ValuePoints, was calculated in the provider‚Äôs wallet. In the Hanang implementation, the available budget in the wallet was used to place orders for necessary supplies, such as equipment, medication. The local PharmAccess team managed the procurement and delivery of supplies based on providers choices. As such the VP system assumed that these incentives would drive improved agency and (collaborative) resource management, ultimately impacting the quality and value of care delivery.",

    "text": "Why did we choose OpenHIE\nThe MomCare Connected Care Stack takes the openHIE framework1 as a starting point, being the most generic and commonly used health information interoperability framework. This framework has by and large been adopted by sub-Saharan African countries2, including Nigeria3, Kenya4 and Tanzania.5\n\n\n\nThe OpenHIE framework\n\n\nThe framework and its components are shown in the figure above. The bottom layer (yellow) comprises the point of service (PoS) systems, which includes the systems used by clinicians, health professionals, community health workers and the like. Examples of such systems are OpenMRS electronic medical records (EMR) system and the RapidSMS mHealth application, which are used to access and update a patient‚Äôs records, register activities and record healthcare transactions.\nThe second, middle layer (teal) constitutes the interoperability layer (IOL), which acts as a gateway for exchanging information between systems. Any type of information exchange, be it between two PoS systems, or between a PoS system and business services (explained below), is mediated through this interoperability layer. The interoperability layer provides functionality such as routing, translation services, auditing and authentication.\nThe top layer of framework comprises three distinct domains. Common Services (blue) include a variety of registry services that are designed to uniquely identify and track unique patients, facilities, healthcare products, and terminology that are used throughout the health data commons. Business Service (green) are designed to support the delivery of care within the health system. The District Health Information System version 2, for example, is a well-known and widely used Health Management Information System for collecting, analyzing, visualizing and sharing data through combining data from multiple PoS systems for a given geography or jurisdiction.6\nThe HDC framework explicitly adds a third domain in the top layer, which is not included in the OpenHIE specification, namely Analytics & Intelligence Services (light blue). The rationale for this addition is to facilitate secondary use of health data for academic research, real-world evidence studies etc. within the nascent concept of health data spaces.7 Note that the Kenyan Health Information Systems Interoperability Framework (KHISIF) has also explicitly included the analytics domain.\nüí¨ TLDR: We adopted the OpenHIE (Open Health Information Exchange) framework because it provides a well-defined, community-driven framework specifically designed for interoperable health systems in LMICs. It aligns with national digital strategies and promotes a sustainable model of digitally connected care that can be replicated across countries and programs. OpenHIE helps MomCare move from standalone digital solutions to a scalable, interoperable platform for maternal healthcare.",

    "text": "MomCare: PharmAccess Maternal & Child Health Program\nMomCare is a digital pregnancy care bundle built on the following three pillars: value-based financing, patient-centered (digital) care delivery and quality improvement tools. It is a set of interventions that together improve health outcomes, enabled by mobile technology and data exchange. To date, MomCare has supported over 60,000 women in Kenya and Tanzania in more than 70 clinics, resulting in good-quality pregnancy journeys at predictable cost.\n\n\nThe MomCare Model\nThe implementation of MomCare started in 2017, leveraging the increasing penetration of mobile technology across Kenya to leapfrog traditional models of maternal care delivery. Recognizing the opportunity for digital innovation, PharmAccess designed MomCare as a care bundle‚Äîa structured set of interventions that, when implemented together, significantly would improve health outcomes. While the MomCare implementations took many shapes over time, its principles led to the development of a combined-digital care model based on three pillars:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPillars\nImplemented Interventions\n\n\n\n\nValue-based financing mechanisms\n- Bundled payments that reimburse care journeys rather than fragmented services  - Bonus incentives (ValuePoints) linked to care quality  - Cesarean section controls to encourage medically appropriate interventions  - Integrated digital claims management to ensure timely provider payments\n\n\nPatient journey tracking\n- Risk stratification  - Digital reminders for appointment adherence  - Provider dashboards for monitoring journeys and health outcomes  - Collecting patient-reported outcomes and experiences\n\n\nQuality improvement\n- Regular quality assessments  - Training programs and workshops  - Network management\n\n\n\nPharmAccess launched MomCare in Kenya (2017) and Tanzania (2019) with the objective to create transparency on the journeys of pregnant mothers. MomCare distinguishes two user groups:\n\n(Expecting) women, who are supported during their pregnancy through reminders and surveys, using their phone as the digital mode of engagement.\nHealth workers, who are equipped with a digital device, in which visits, care activities and clinical observations are recorded.\n\nReimbursements of the maternal clinic are based on the data captured with patient-engagements and the provider device, thereby creating a conditional payment scheme, where providers are partially reimbursed up-front for a fixed bundle of activities, supplemented by bonus payments based on a predefined set of care activities.\n\n\nThe Need for Health Information Exchange\nIn its earlier implementations, the MomCare program was able to connect care journeys, but it did not support interoperable data exchange.\nFor example in Kenya, M-TIBA is used as the primary data source, on top of which a relatively lightweight custom app has been built as the engagement layer for the health workers. M-TIBA provides data access through its data warehouse platform for the MomCare program. However, this is not a standardized, general purpose API.\nIn the case of Tanzania, a stand-alone custom app was used which does not provide an interface of any kind for interacting with the platform. Given these constraints, the MomCare program used a custom-built data warehouse environment as its main data platform, on which data extractions, transformations and analysis were performed to generate the operational reports. Feedback reports for the health workers, in the form of operational dashboards, were made accessible through the app. Similar reports were provided to the back-office for the periodic reimbursement to the clinics.\nWhile effective in context, these custom data architectures posed serious challenges to scalability, standardization, and reusability. They created a dependency on manual integrations and limited the potential to scale components of the MomCare model with local governments and other partners.\n\n\nConnecting Care Journeys\nWithin the this context of the MomCare program, we have built a number of demonstrators (components) to show how connected pregnancy care journeys can be achieved using a standardized, open-source digital architecture. We want to demonstrate that patient-centric data access and reuse is feasible, today. We take the approach of ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù. Through implementing demonstrator projects that contribute towards the creation of a digitally connected care journey, we show that health data sharing can be achieved in LMICs at acceptable cost and low technical risk. This document describes the learnings from implementations within the MomCare program. Through these demonstrators we aim to encourage a paradigm shift as to how data sharing can be realized such that it can act as a catalyst towards improved healthcare outcomes.",
